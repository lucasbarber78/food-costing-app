## Food Costing Application Project Summary

I've created a comprehensive knowledge base for the Food Costing Application project. This application is designed to help culinary professionals accurately convert measurements, calculate costs, manage recipes, and track inventory based on principles from The Book of Yields.

### Key Components

1. **Database Design**
   - A relational PostgreSQL database with a hierarchical structure for items
   - Sophisticated unit conversion system with both general and item-specific conversions
   - Yield factor tracking for cooking and trimming processes
   - Price history for accurate cost trending

2. **Conversion Engine**
   - Implements core formulas from The Book of Yields
   - Supports multi-step conversion paths between units
   - Handles weight-to-volume conversions with item-specific density factors
   - Applies yield factors for cooking and trimming

3. **Recipe Management**
   - CRUD operations for recipes and ingredients
   - Recipe scaling with proportional adjustments
   - Cost calculation based on current ingredient pricing
   - Purchase list generation with yield factor application

4. **Inventory Management**
   - Real-time inventory tracking by location
   - Par level monitoring
   - Inventory count workflows
   - Valuation methods (FIFO, weighted average)

5. **User Interface**
   - Interactive conversion calculator
   - Recipe editing and costing interface
   - Inventory management dashboards
   - Purchase planning tools

### Implementation Plan

The project will be implemented over approximately 20 weeks, divided into phases:
1. Project Setup & Database Design (3 weeks)
2. Core Backend Development (4 weeks)
3. Frontend Framework & Core Features (4 weeks)
4. Inventory Management & Integration (4 weeks)
5. Testing, Deployment & Training (5 weeks)

### Data Migration

A comprehensive data migration plan has been created to import existing data from CSV files into the new database structure, including:
- Validation and cleansing of source data
- Mapping of fields from CSV to database schema
- Handling of relationships and conversions
- Verification of migrated data integrity

### Testing Strategy

The testing plan includes:
- Unit testing for individual components
- Integration testing between application modules
- UI testing for user interfaces
- Performance testing for system optimization
- Security testing to identify vulnerabilities
- User acceptance testing with real-world scenarios

### GitHub Repository

A GitHub repository has been created at: https://github.com/lucasbarber78/food-costing-app with the initial project structure and documentation.

This application will provide significant value to culinary professionals by automating complex calculations, ensuring accurate costing, and streamlining inventory managementâ€”all based on the established principles from The Book of Yields.
