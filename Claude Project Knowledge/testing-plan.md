# Food Costing Application Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Food Costing Application. Our testing approach includes unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing to ensure all aspects of the system function correctly and meet requirements.

## Testing Objectives

1. Validate the core conversion and calculation algorithms against known examples from The Book of Yields
2. Ensure data integrity and consistency across all operations
3. Verify proper functioning of user interfaces and workflows
4. Confirm system security and access controls
5. Measure performance under various load conditions
6. Validate integration between all system components

## Test Environments

### Development Environment
- Purpose: Development and unit testing
- Configuration: Local development environment
- Database: Dedicated development database with test data
- Access: Development team only

### Testing Environment
- Purpose: Integration and system testing
- Configuration: Mirrors production environment
- Database: Dedicated test database with complete test dataset
- Access: Development and QA teams

### Staging Environment
- Purpose: User acceptance testing and final validation
- Configuration: Identical to production environment
- Database: Clone of production data (anonymized where required)
- Access: Development, QA, and selected end users

## Testing Types

### 1. Unit Testing

**Objective**: Validate individual components and functions in isolation.

**Key Areas**:
- Conversion algorithms
- Yield factor calculations
- Recipe costing functions
- Inventory calculations
- Data access methods

**Tools**:
- Jest for JavaScript testing
- Supertest for API endpoint testing

**Approach**:
- Write test cases for each core function
- Use mocks for external dependencies
- Automate tests to run on each code commit
- Maintain >80% code coverage

**Example Test Cases**:

```javascript
// Unit conversion test
test('Convert pounds to ounces', () => {
  expect(convertUnits(1, 'lb', 'oz')).toBe(16);
});

// Yield factor application test
test('Apply 80% yield factor to 5 pounds', () => {
  expect(applyYieldFactor(5, 0.8)).toBe(4);
});

// Recipe cost calculation test
test('Calculate recipe cost with known ingredients', () => {
  const ingredients = [
    { quantity: 2, unitCost: 3.5 },
    { quantity: 1.5, unitCost: 2.0 }
  ];
  expect(calculateRecipeCost(ingredients)).toBe(10);
});
```
