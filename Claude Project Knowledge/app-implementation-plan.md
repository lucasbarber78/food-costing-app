## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

1. **Data Migration Complexity**: Existing CSV data may have inconsistencies or gaps
   - Mitigation: Thorough data analysis and cleansing before migration

2. **Calculation Accuracy**: Critical for cost calculations to be precise
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive unit testing and validation against manual calculations

3. **User Adoption**: New system requires change management
   - Mitigation: Early stakeholder involvement and comprehensive training

4. **Performance Issues**: Large recipe or inventory datasets could impact performance
   - Mitigation: Performance testing with realistic data volumes and optimization

5. **Integration Challenges**: Various subsystems must work seamlessly together
   - Mitigation: Clear interface definitions and incremental integration testing

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All existing CSV data is successfully migrated to the new system
2. Cost calculations match The Book of Yields formulas with 100% accuracy
3. Recipe scaling and purchasing calculations work correctly for all test cases
4. System can handle the expected volume of recipes, ingredients, and inventory items
5. Users are able to complete key workflows efficiently
6. System generates accurate reports and analysis
7. Data integrity is maintained throughout all operations

## Evaluation Plan

Regular checkpoints will be conducted throughout the project to evaluate progress:

- Weekly development team standups
- Bi-weekly stakeholder progress reviews
- Monthly milestone demonstrations
- User testing at the end of each major phase
- Final acceptance testing before launch

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to developing the Food Costing Application, ensuring that all aspects of the system are addressed and that the final product meets the needs of culinary professionals for accurate measurement conversion, recipe costing, and inventory management.
